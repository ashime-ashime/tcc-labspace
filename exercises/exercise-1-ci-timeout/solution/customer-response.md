**Subject:** Resolution for GitHub Actions CI pipeline timeout with Testcontainers Cloud

**Date:** [Today's Date]

**Ticket:** #TCC-2025-001

---

Dear Enterprise Development Team,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your CI/CD pipeline failures. We have completed our investigation and identified the root causes of the issue.

## Root Cause Analysis

Our investigation revealed **two distinct issues** affecting your GitHub Actions workflow:

### 1. Account Usage Limitation

Your Testcontainers Cloud account has exceeded its allocated usage limit. Our analysis shows:

- **Account Plan:** Legacy trial with 50 minutes of free TCC usage per month
- **Current Usage:** 52 minutes (exceeded by 2 minutes)
- **Quota Status:** Exhausted as of January 9, 2025
- **Last Successful CI:** January 8, 2025 at 14:22:00

This explains why your pipeline started failing approximately 48 hours ago - it correlates directly with your quota exhaustion date.

### 2. Workflow Configuration Gap

Additionally, your GitHub Actions workflow is missing the required Testcontainers Cloud setup action. Without this action, the TCC agent cannot establish a connection to our cloud infrastructure, even if quota were available.

## Why Local Tests Work

Your local development environment uses Docker Desktop, which:
- Does not consume TCC cloud minutes
- Runs containers directly on your infrastructure
- Is not subject to TCC plan limitations

This is why the same tests that fail in CI pass successfully on developer machines.

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Actions:

**1. Add Missing TCC Setup Action**

Update your GitHub Actions workflow to include:

```yaml
- name: Set up Testcontainers Cloud
  uses: atomicjar/testcontainers-cloud-setup-action@v1
  with:
    wait: true
    token: ${{ secrets.TESTCONTAINERS_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

See the attached `fixed-workflow.yml` for the complete corrected configuration.

**2. Address Usage Limitation**

You have several options:

**Option A: Upgrade Your Plan (Recommended)**
- Upgrade to Docker Business or Team plan
- TCC minutes included in subscription
- Higher usage limits and additional features
- Eliminates separate billing concerns

**Option B: Optimize CI Usage**
- Implement container reuse strategies
- Reduce test execution frequency  
- Run only critical tests in CI
- Use local testing for development

**Option C: Temporary Workaround**
- Continue local testing while evaluating upgrade options
- Reserve CI for final validation only
- Monitor usage through TCC dashboard

### Long-Term Recommendations:

1. **Monitor TCC Usage:** Check your dashboard regularly at https://app.testcontainers.cloud/
2. **Implement Container Reuse:** Optimize tests to reuse containers where possible
3. **Consider Plan Upgrade:** For production workloads, a paid plan provides predictable costs
4. **Set Up Alerts:** Configure notifications for usage thresholds

## Next Steps

1. Apply the workflow configuration fix
2. Choose a usage limitation solution that fits your needs
3. Test the updated workflow in a feature branch
4. Monitor TCC dashboard after deployment

We're confident these changes will restore your CI/CD pipeline functionality. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with implementation.
