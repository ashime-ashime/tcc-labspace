# Exercise 1: CI Pipeline Timeout

## Overview

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Focus:** GitHub Actions + TCC troubleshooting  
**Type:** Self-directed break-and-fix investigation

## Scenario

A customer's GitHub Actions CI pipeline has been failing for 48 hours. The workflow times out during Testcontainers Cloud setup, but local tests work perfectly. Your mission: investigate and identify the root cause.

## Investigation Steps

**ðŸ“‹ For detailed step-by-step instructions, see: `TSE-GUIDE.md`**

**Follow these steps to complete your TSE analysis:**

### **Step 1: Read the Customer Ticket**
```bash
cat TICKET.txt
```

### **Step 2: Investigate Customer Data**
```bash
cd customer-data/
ls -la

# Check the CI logs
cat ci-logs.txt

# Review the workflow configuration
cat workflow/test.yml

# Examine account information
cat account-info.json
cat usage-data.txt
```

### **Step 3: Analyze the Issue**
- Review all customer data thoroughly
- Identify patterns and inconsistencies
- Form your hypothesis about the root cause

### **Step 4: Submit Your Analysis**
```bash
# Run the analysis script
./analyze-issue.sh
```

**The script will ask you:**
1. Your name (for tracking)
2. What you think is the root cause
3. What solution you recommend

**Your analysis will be saved automatically with your name and timestamp for instructor review.**
