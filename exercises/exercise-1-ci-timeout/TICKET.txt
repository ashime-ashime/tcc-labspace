SUBJECT:        GitHub Actions CI pipeline timeout with Testcontainers Cloud
PRIORITY:       🔴 HIGH - Blocking production deployments
CUSTOMER:       Enterprise Development Team (Fortune 500)
REPORTED:       48 hours ago
STATUS:         CRITICAL - Escalated to L2 Support

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:

Our CI/CD pipeline has been failing for the past 48 hours. The GitHub Actions 
workflow that sets up Testcontainers Cloud is timing out after approximately 
2 minutes during the setup phase.

The same test suite runs perfectly when executed locally on developer machines 
using Docker Desktop. No configuration changes were made to our Testcontainers 
setup before this issue started.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

  • Platform: GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest)
  • Test Framework: Java with Maven
  • TCC Integration: Recently adopted Testcontainers Cloud
  • Test Suite: Integration tests with PostgreSQL containers
  • Local Environment: Works flawlessly with Docker Desktop
  • Pipeline Timing: Fails during TCC setup phase (before tests run)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT CUSTOMER HAS TRIED:

  ✓ Regenerated service account token (as suggested in documentation)
  ✓ Verified TCC service status dashboard (all systems operational)
  ✓ Checked network connectivity from GitHub Actions runners
  ✓ Restarted GitHub Actions runners
  ✓ Reviewed workflow YAML for syntax errors
  
  Result: No improvement - issue persists

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 YOUR MISSION:

  1. Investigate the provided customer data
  2. Identify the root cause of the CI pipeline failure
  3. Determine the appropriate solution
  4. Document your findings for the customer

💡 TIPS:

  • Start by examining the CI logs for error messages
  • Compare local (working) vs CI (failing) environments
  • Don't assume - gather all evidence before concluding
  • The mock TCC API is available for diagnostic queries

Good luck! The customer is counting on you.
