# Testcontainers Cloud (TCC) Support Labs

Real-world break-and-fix scenarios for Technical Support Engineers. Build your TCC troubleshooting skills through hands-on investigation of authentic customer issues.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the lab environment
docker run -it ashimeashime006/tcc-lab:latest

# Navigate to an exercise and start investigating
cd exercises/exercise-1-ci-timeout
cat TICKET.txt
```

**No setup required!** The environment is pre-configured and ready for investigation.

## Lab Philosophy

**Self-Directed Investigation:**
- Read actual customer tickets
- Investigate real logs and configurations
- Find issues yourself (no hand-holding)
- Senior TSE-level challenges

**Authentic TSE Experience:**
- Real support scenarios
- Customer-provided data
- Professional troubleshooting workflow
- Evidence-based problem solving

## Available Exercises

### Exercise 1: CI Pipeline Timeout

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Focus:** GitHub Actions + TCC troubleshooting

**Scenario:** Enterprise customer's CI/CD pipeline failing for 48 hours. Workflow times out during TCC setup. Local tests work perfectly. Find the root cause.

**Location:** `exercises/exercise-1-ci-timeout/`
