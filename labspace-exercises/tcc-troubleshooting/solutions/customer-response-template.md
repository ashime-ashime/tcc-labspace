**Subject: Re: Testcontainers Cloud connection failing - "No Docker activity detected"**

Hi [Customer Name],

Thanks for reaching out about your TCC connection issue. I've investigated your case and can help you resolve this "No Docker activity detected" error.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue is that your Testcontainers Desktop is not configured to connect to Testcontainers Cloud. Here's what I found:

**Current Configuration:**
- Desktop is running in "Local" mode only
- Cloud mode is disabled in your configuration
- TCC authentication is not configured
- Your TCC account and service account token are valid and active

**Why You're Getting "No Docker activity detected":**
- Desktop is not connected to TCC cloud infrastructure
- Tests are trying to run in cloud but Desktop can't connect
- Authentication token is not configured in Desktop settings

## üöÄ Solution

Here's how to fix this issue:

### Step 1: Configure Testcontainers Desktop for TCC

1. **Open Testcontainers Desktop**
2. **Go to Settings** (gear icon in the app)
3. **Click on "Cloud" tab**
4. **Enable "Use Testcontainers Cloud"**
5. **Enter your Organization ID**: `customer-org-12345`
6. **Enter your Service Account Token**: `tcct_abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz`
7. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Restart Testcontainers Desktop

After configuring the settings:
1. **Quit Testcontainers Desktop completely**
2. **Restart the application**
3. **Verify it shows "Cloud" mode in the status bar**

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

Run your test again:
```bash
python simple-test.py
```

You should now see your tests running in the TCC cloud environment!

## üìö Understanding the Issue

**What Happened:**
- You successfully signed up for TCC and created a service account
- However, Testcontainers Desktop wasn't configured to use TCC

**Why This Happens:**
- TCC sign-up and Desktop configuration are separate steps

After following the solution, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Desktop shows "Cloud" mode in status bar
