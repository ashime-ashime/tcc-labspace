# Solution Summary: The Connection Mystery

## üéØ Root Cause
**Testcontainers Desktop Not Configured for TCC**
- Desktop running in "Local" mode only
- Cloud mode disabled in configuration
- TCC authentication not configured
- Customer has valid TCC account and service account token

## üîç Key Insights

### Why "No Docker activity detected" Occurs
- **Desktop Configuration**: Desktop not configured to connect to TCC
- **Authentication**: Service account token not provided to Desktop
