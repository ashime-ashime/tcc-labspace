**Subject: Re: GitHub Actions failing with TCC - "Service account authentication failed"**

Hi [Customer Name],

Thanks for reaching out about your TCC CI/CD authentication issue. I've investigated your case and can help you resolve this "Service account authentication failed" error.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue is that your GitHub Actions workflow is missing the TCC setup action. Here's what I found:

**Current Configuration:**
- Service account token is properly configured in GitHub Secrets ‚úÖ
- Token is valid and active ‚úÖ
- TCC account has quota remaining ‚úÖ
- **Missing**: TCC setup action in your GitHub Actions workflow ‚ùå

**Why You're Getting "Service account authentication failed":**
- Your workflow has the token but doesn't set up the TCC agent
- Tests try to connect to TCC without the agent being configured
- The TCC agent is required to authenticate with the cloud service

## üöÄ Solution

Here's how to fix your GitHub Actions workflow:

### Step 1: Add TCC Setup Action

Add this step to your `.github/workflows/test.yml` **before** running tests:

```yaml
- name: Set up Testcontainers Cloud
  uses: atomicjar/testcontainers-cloud-setup-action@v1
  with:
    wait: true
    token: ${{ secrets.TESTCONTAINERS_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

### Step 2: Complete Updated Workflow

Here's your complete fixed workflow:

```yaml
name: Test with Testcontainers Cloud

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install testcontainers[postgres] psycopg2-binary pytest
        
    - name: Set up Testcontainers Cloud
      uses: atomicjar/testcontainers-cloud-setup-action@v1
      with:
        wait: true
        token: ${{ secrets.TESTCONTAINERS_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
        
    - name: Run tests
      run: python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Step 3: Test Your Updated Workflow

1. **Commit and push** your updated workflow
2. **Trigger the workflow** by pushing to your repository
3. **Check the logs** - you should see TCC agent setup and successful test execution

## üìö Understanding the Issue

**What Happened:**
- You correctly configured the service account token in GitHub Secrets
- However, your workflow was missing the TCC setup action
- The TCC agent needs to be configured before tests can authenticate

**Why This Happens:**
- TCC requires an agent to be set up in CI environments
- The service account token alone isn't sufficient
- The setup action configures the agent to authenticate with TCC

**Local vs CI Difference:**
- **Local**: Testcontainers Desktop handles TCC authentication automatically
- **CI**: Requires explicit TCC agent setup via the setup action

## üîß Verification Steps

After following the solution, you should see:
- ‚úÖ TCC setup action completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Tests run in TCC cloud environment
- ‚úÖ No more "Service account authentication failed" errors
- ‚úÖ Your TCC dashboard shows CI usage activity
