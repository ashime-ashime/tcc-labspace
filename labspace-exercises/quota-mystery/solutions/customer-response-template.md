**Subject: Re: Testcontainers Cloud not working in GitHub Actions**

Hi [Customer Name],

Thanks for reaching out about your TCC CI issues. I've investigated your case and can help you resolve this.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue is that your TCC free tier quota has been exhausted. Here's what I found:

**Your Usage:**
- Current CI usage: 52 minutes
- Quota limit: 50 minutes (one-time)
- Status: Quota exceeded since January 9th

**Why Local Works But CI Fails:**
- **Local Desktop usage**: Unlimited (runs on your machine)
- **CI/CD usage**: Counts against your 50-minute quota

This is why your tests work locally but fail in GitHub Actions.

## 📊 Account Details

You're currently on a **legacy trial account** which has different limitations:
- Free tier: 50 minutes (one-time use, not monthly)
- Legacy Docker Pro: Doesn't include TCC minutes
- New consolidated plans: Include TCC minutes

## 🚀 Solution Options

### Option 1: Upgrade to New Docker Pro Plan
- **Cost**: $5/month
- **Benefits**: 100 TCC minutes/month included
- **Action**: Upgrade through Docker Hub

### Option 2: Optimize Your Tests
- Use container sharing to reduce usage
- Run tests locally for development
- Use CI only for final validation

### Option 3: Use Local Testing
- Unlimited local usage for development
- Use CI only when necessary
- Most cost-effective for development

## 📚 Understanding the Billing Model

**Local Usage (Unlimited):**
- Runs on your machine
- No quota consumption
- Shows as "Local" in dashboard

**CI/CD Usage (Quota Limited):**
- Runs in TCC infrastructure
- Consumes quota minutes
- Shows as "Cloud" in dashboard

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use local testing for development
2. **Short-term**: Upgrade to new Docker Pro plan
3. **Long-term**: Optimize CI usage with container sharing

## 📞 Support

If you need help with any of these options or have questions about the billing model, please let me know. I'm here to help you get back up and running.

Best regards,
