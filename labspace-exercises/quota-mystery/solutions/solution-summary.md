# Solution Summary: The Quota Mystery

## üéØ Root Cause
**Quota Exhaustion on Legacy Trial Account**
- Customer used 52 minutes of CI/CD quota
- Legacy trial limit: 50 minutes (one-time)
- Quota exceeded on January 9th, 2025

## üîç Key Insights

### Why Local Works But CI Fails
- **Local Desktop**: Unlimited usage (runs on customer's machine)
- **CI/CD**: Quota-limited usage (runs in TCC infrastructure)
- **Billing Model**: Different rules for local vs cloud execution

### Legacy vs New Plan Differences
- **Legacy Docker Pro**: No TCC minutes included
- **New Docker Pro**: 100 TCC minutes/month included
- **Legacy Trial**: 50 minutes one-time (not monthly)
- **New Trial**: 50 minutes one-time

### Customer Confusion Points
- **Documentation**: Outdated 300 minutes/month messaging
- **Dashboard**: "Local" usage appears but isn't quota-limited
