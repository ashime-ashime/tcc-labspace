# Working Solution: The Quota Mystery

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue**: Missing TCC setup action in GitHub Actions workflow
**Secondary Issue**: Quota exhaustion on legacy trial account

## üîç What Was Broken

### GitHub Actions Workflow Issues:
1. **Missing TCC setup action** - No connection to Testcontainers Cloud
2. **Token configured but no agent** - Environment variable set but no TCC agent
3. **Timeout errors** - Workflow times out waiting for TCC connection

### Account Issues:
1. **Legacy trial account** - Bound to free trial limits
2. **Quota exhaustion** - 52 minutes used, 50-minute limit exceeded
3. **Billing confusion** - Local vs CI usage differences

## ‚úÖ Complete Solution

### Step 1: Fix GitHub Actions Workflow

**Add the missing TCC setup action:**

```yaml
- name: Set up Testcontainers Cloud
  uses: atomicjar/testcontainers-cloud-setup-action@v1
  with:
    wait: true
    token: ${{ secrets.TESTCONTAINERS_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

**Complete fixed workflow is in `test.yml`**

### Step 2: Address Quota Issues

**For immediate resolution:**
- Explain quota exhaustion (52/50 minutes used)
- Clarify local vs CI billing differences
- Recommend upgrade to new Docker Pro plan

**For long-term solution:**
- Upgrade to new Docker Pro plan (includes TCC minutes)
- Implement container reuse to optimize usage
- Monitor usage in TCC dashboard

## üéØ Why This Solution Works

### Technical Fix:
- **TCC agent setup** - Establishes connection to Testcontainers Cloud
- **Proper authentication** - Token now works with configured agent
- **No more timeouts** - Workflow can connect to TCC successfully

### Business Fix:
- **Clear billing explanation** - Customer understands quota limits
- **Upgrade path** - Clear recommendation for new plan
- **Usage optimization** - Strategies to reduce quota consumption

## üìö Key Learnings

### For TSEs:
1. **Check workflow configuration first** - Missing TCC setup is common
2. **Verify quota status** - Always check account limits
3. **Explain billing models** - Local vs CI usage differences
4. **Provide upgrade options** - Clear path forward for customers

### For Customers:
1. **TCC requires agent setup** - Token alone isn't sufficient
2. **Monitor quota usage** - Check TCC dashboard regularly
3. **Understand billing** - Local usage is unlimited, CI usage counts
4. **Consider upgrades** - New plans include TCC minutes
