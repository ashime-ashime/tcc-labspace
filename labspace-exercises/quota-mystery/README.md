# The Quota Mystery - Customer Issue Report

## üö® Support Ticket Details

**Subject**: GitHub Actions CI pipeline timeout with Testcontainers Cloud

**Priority**: High - Blocking deployments

**Customer**: Enterprise development team

**Timeline**: Started 48 hours ago

---

## üìã Customer Description

Our CI/CD pipeline has been failing for the past 48 hours. Here's what's happening:

### The Problem
- **GitHub Actions workflow** that sets up Testcontainers Cloud is **timing out after 2 minutes**
- **Pipeline fails during TCC setup phase** - before any test execution begins
- **Same tests work perfectly** when run locally on developer machines
- **No recent changes** to our Testcontainers configuration

### What We've Tried
- **Regenerated service account token** (as suggested in docs) - didn't work
- **Checked TCC service status** - service is operational
- **Verified network connectivity** - no issues
- **Restarted GitHub Actions runners** - no effect

### Business Impact
- **Blocking our deployment pipeline** - can't release new features
- **Affecting release schedule** - quarterly update delayed
- **Developer productivity** - team can't validate changes in CI
- **Customer expectations** - promised features delayed

## üîç Technical Context

### Our Setup
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Test Framework**: Java with Maven
- **TCC Integration**: Recently started using Testcontainers Cloud
- **Test Suite**: Integration tests with database containers
- **Local Environment**: Works perfectly with Docker Desktop

### The Workflow
```yaml
# Our current GitHub Actions workflow
name: Test with Testcontainers Cloud
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
    - name: Run tests
      run: mvn test
      env:
        TESTCONTAINERS_CLOUD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TESTCONTAINERS_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

### What We Expect
- Tests should run in TCC cloud environment
- Workflow should complete successfully
- Same behavior as local development

### What Actually Happens
- Workflow starts normally
- Gets to "Run tests" step
- Hangs for ~2 minutes
- Times out with no clear error message
- No tests actually execute

## ü§î Customer Confusion

We're confused because:
1. **Local tests work fine** - same code, same configuration
2. **TCC service is up** - status page shows operational
3. **Token is configured** - we regenerated it as suggested
4. **No error messages** - just timeout, no specific failure

---

## üìû What We Need

Please help us understand:
1. **Why is the CI pipeline timing out?**
2. **Why does local work but CI fails?**
3. **Is this a configuration issue or service issue?**
4. **How can we get our CI/CD pipeline working again?**

We need this resolved quickly as it's blocking our development workflow.

## üïµÔ∏è TSE Investigation Mission

As the assigned TSE, you need to:

1. **Analyze the failing CI/CD pipeline**
2. **Determine why local works but CI fails**
3. **Identify the root cause**
4. **Provide actionable solution**

---

## üîç Investigation Process

### Phase 1: Environment Analysis

Examine the customer's CI configuration:

```bash
cd customer-report/broken-repo
cat .github/workflows/test.yml
```

Review the failure logs:

```bash
cat customer-report/github-actions-logs.txt
```

### Phase 2: Account Investigation

Check account configuration:

```bash
cat customer-report/account-details.json
```

Analyze usage patterns:

```bash
cat customer-report/usage-dashboard-screenshot.txt
```

---

## üéØ Key Investigation Areas

### Critical Questions:
1. **What's causing the CI timeout?**
2. **Why does local execution work?**
3. **Is this account-related or configuration-related?**
4. **What changed 48 hours ago?**
5. **Are there billing or quota implications?**

### Diagnostic Approach:
```bash
# Verify TCC service status
curl https://api.testcontainers.cloud/v1/health

# Check account quota (if token available)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     https://api.testcontainers.cloud/v1/usage

# Validate service account permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     https://api.testcontainers.cloud/v1/account
```

<details>
<summary>Click for hints (use only if stuck)</summary>

**Hint 1**: Focus on account type - legacy vs current billing models

**Hint 2**: Examine usage dashboard data carefully

**Hint 3**: Consider local vs cloud execution differences

**Hint 4**: This may be a quota/billing issue, not technical
