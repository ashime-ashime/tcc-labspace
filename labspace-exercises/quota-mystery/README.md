# Exercise 1: The Quota Mystery

## üö® Customer Issue Report

### Support Ticket Details

**Subject**: GitHub Actions CI pipeline timeout with Testcontainers Cloud

**Priority**: High - Blocking deployments

**Customer**: Enterprise development team

**Description**: 
Our CI/CD pipeline started failing 48 hours ago. The GitHub Actions workflow that sets up Testcontainers Cloud is timing out after approximately 2 minutes. We've attempted to resolve this by regenerating our service account token, but the issue persists.

Our local development environment works perfectly - tests run without issues when executed from developer machines. However, the same tests fail in our GitHub Actions environment.

**Technical Details**:
- Pipeline fails during TCC setup phase
- Timeout occurs before any test execution begins
- No recent changes to our Testcontainers configuration
- Only dependency update was OpenRewrite plugin version bump
- Service account token regeneration had no effect

**Business Impact**: 
This is blocking our deployment pipeline and affecting our release schedule.

## üïµÔ∏è Investigation Mission

As the assigned TSE, you need to:

1. **Analyze the failing CI/CD pipeline**
2. **Determine why local works but CI fails**
3. **Identify the root cause**
4. **Provide actionable solution**

## üîç Investigation Process

### Phase 1: Environment Analysis

Examine the customer's CI configuration:

```bash
cd customer-report/broken-repo
cat .github/workflows/test.yml
```

Review the failure logs:

```bash
cat customer-report/github-actions-logs.txt
```

### Phase 2: Account Investigation

Check account configuration:

```bash
cat customer-report/account-details.json
```

Analyze usage patterns:

```bash
cat customer-report/usage-dashboard-screenshot.txt
```

## üéØ Key Investigation Areas

### Critical Questions:
1. **What's causing the CI timeout?**
2. **Why does local execution work?**
3. **Is this account-related or configuration-related?**
4. **What changed 48 hours ago?**
5. **Are there billing or quota implications?**

### Diagnostic Approach:
```bash
# Verify TCC service status
curl https://api.testcontainers.cloud/v1/health

# Check account quota (if token available)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     https://api.testcontainers.cloud/v1/usage

# Validate service account permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     https://api.testcontainers.cloud/v1/account
```

## üìã Investigation Checklist

**Hint 1**: Focus on account type - legacy vs current billing models

**Hint 2**: Examine usage dashboard data carefully

**Hint 3**: Consider local vs cloud execution differences

**Hint 4**: This may be a quota/billing issue, not technical
