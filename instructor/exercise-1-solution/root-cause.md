# Root Cause Analysis - Exercise 1

## üéØ Root Cause Identified

### Primary Issue: TCC Quota Exhausted

**Evidence:**
- `customer-data/ci-logs.txt`: Shows "Quota exceeded" error during TCC setup
- `customer-data/account-info.json`: Reveals `quota_exceeded: true` and `current_month_usage: 52` out of `free_tier_minutes: 50`
- `customer-data/usage-data.txt`: Confirms quota exhausted on 2025-01-09, matching the 48-hour timeline

### Secondary Issue: Missing TCC Setup Action

**Evidence:**
- `customer-data/workflow/test.yml`: Missing `atomicjar/testcontainers-cloud-setup-action@v1` step
- Without this action, TCC agent cannot establish connection to Testcontainers Cloud
- Token is configured but agent setup is absent

## üîç Why Local Works But CI Fails

**Local Environment (Docker Desktop):**
- ‚úÖ Tests run directly against local Docker daemon
- ‚úÖ No TCC minutes consumed
- ‚úÖ Unlimited local container usage
- ‚úÖ No quota restrictions

**CI Environment (GitHub Actions + TCC):**
- ‚ùå Requires TCC setup action to connect to cloud
- ‚ùå Consumes TCC minutes from account quota
- ‚ùå Subject to plan limitations
- ‚ùå Quota exceeded = cannot connect

**This explains the "48 hours ago" timeline:** The customer exhausted their 50-minute free tier quota, and subsequent CI runs failed when trying to use TCC.

## üìä Account Details Analysis

**Plan Type:** `trial_legacy`
- Legacy trial account with separate TCC billing
- 50 minutes free tier per month
- `tcc_included: false` (not bundled with Docker Pro)

**Usage Pattern:**
- Month-to-date usage: 52 minutes
- Free tier limit: 50 minutes
- Status: QUOTA EXCEEDED
- Last successful CI: 2025-01-08 14:22:00
- Quota exhausted: 2025-01-09 00:00:00

**Timeline Correlation:**
- Customer reported issue "48 hours ago"
- Quota exhausted date aligns with failure timeline
- Perfect match - this is the smoking gun!

## ‚úÖ Complete Solution

### Fix #1: Add Missing TCC Setup Action (Immediate)

The workflow needs the TCC setup action:

```yaml
- name: Set up Testcontainers Cloud
  uses: atomicjar/testcontainers-cloud-setup-action@v1
  with:
    wait: true
    token: ${{ secrets.TESTCONTAINERS_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
```

See `solution/fixed-workflow.yml` for complete corrected workflow.

### Fix #2: Address Quota Limitation (Long-term)

**Option A: Upgrade Plan (Recommended)**
- Upgrade to Docker Business or Team plan
- Includes TCC minutes in subscription
- No separate billing or quota concerns

**Option B: Optimize Usage**
- Implement container reuse in tests
- Reduce test execution frequency
- Run only critical tests in CI

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Use local testing for development
- Reserve CI/TCC for final validation
- Monitor usage in TCC dashboard

## üéì Key Learnings for TSEs

### Common TCC Issues to Remember:

1. **Missing Setup Action**
   - TCC requires explicit setup in CI workflows
   - Token alone is not sufficient
   - Easy to overlook during initial configuration

2. **Quota Limitations**
   - Free tier has usage limits (50 minutes/month)
   - Legacy plans have separate TCC billing
   - Quota resets monthly (or never for trial legacy)

3. **Local vs CI Differences**
   - Local Docker Desktop doesn't consume TCC minutes
   - CI environments require TCC for cloud execution
   - Environment parity issues are common

4. **Timeline Investigation**
   - Usage exhaustion dates often correlate with issue start
   - Check dashboards and usage reports
   - Timeline analysis reveals patterns
